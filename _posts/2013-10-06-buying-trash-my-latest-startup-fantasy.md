Every developer in Silicon Valley, like the 49er's here two centuries ago, dreams of striking gold. I'm no different. I love my day job, but I always find myself hankering to *create* something novel and (hopefully) profitable.

I've also spent a fair amount of time pondering how to make the world a better place. In all honesty, there's no shortage of room for new and effective entrepreneurs in the world improvement business. However, one idea that's captured my imagination recently is buying trash. Yes, trash. The idea: fuel a power generator using people's rubbish.

Think I'm crazy? This idea has worked so well [in Sweden they've run out of trash](http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/recycling/blogs/sweden-runs-out-of-garbage-forced-to-import-from-norway). In fact, Sweden is importing trash from Norway because it's so desperate for more. Admittedly, Sweden's government is behind this strategy rather a private company, and it's possible that the barrier to entry is just too high for any startup to take on. 

However, I find this idea so compelling &mdash; emptying landfills to solve the energy crisis &mdash; that I really don't care if this is a government project or private firm. Either way, I want it here. If you share my interest in this idea, contact me using the contact form on this site, twitter, or LinkedIn.
