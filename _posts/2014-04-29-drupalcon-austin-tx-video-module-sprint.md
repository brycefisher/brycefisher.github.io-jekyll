I'm super excited for [DrupalCon Austin](https://austin2014.drupal.org/)! Since becoming a new maintainer on the illustrious [Video Module](http://drupal.org/project/video), I've been gathering feedback from the issue queue and wanting to really dive deep on the outstanding bugs and low hanging feature requests. If you're there, let's meet up for a Birds of a Feather.

## The Week's Hitlist

My goal for DrupalCon Austin is to roll out a new release (video-7.x-2.11). Ideally, I'd like to:

 + Streamline the process from `drush dl video` to seeing a player on the page
 + Make sure that Firefox can play transcoded videos
 + Make responsive players easier to setup
 + Roll out some REAL documentation on drupal.org

I'm definitely open to other features and bug fixes -- just show up, and we'll see if we can roll it into the new release.

## Newbies Welcome

Never rolled a patch before? Struggling with arcane git commands? Just message / tweet me and we'll work on it together while updating the module.

## Experts Welcome Too!

Personally, I'm still getting up to speed on FFMpeg and some of the sublties of video. I'd love to get some more pointers during this sprint. If all goes according to plan, we'll be creating a new release. I haven't done this before -- if you're an experienced module maintainer, I'd love to have you on my team!
